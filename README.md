Find coffee for developers

Hi reviewrs,

It is done now but not in only two hours. I worked more than half a day on this project.

I developed it with Android Studio.
It doesn't need anything special tu run, just import project in the IDE.
It is using Picasso to load the images. When a venuw has a phone number you can call it. 
To improve the code in the future, I will use gson to parse. It was my first experience with foursquare.
I requested for more time to finish it over the weekend but I managed my time to do it on after hours in the working days.
Thanks again to extend my deadline fortunately it is finalized now.

I hope you love it.
Friday night, heading to a pub.
