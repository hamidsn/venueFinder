Find coffee for developers

Hi reviewrs,

It is done now but not in only two hours. I worked more than half a day on this project.

I developed it with Android Studio.
It doesn't need anything special to run, just import project in the IDE.
It used OkHttp to call API and Picasso to load the images. When a venue has a phone number you can call it. I could download lat and lon of the venue and send it to Google Maps via intent but I think it is enough.(honestly I didn't have time)
To improve the code in the future, I will use gson to parse. Ley me say I do not like current method of calling API and parse the result , it is a little messy. 

I requested for more time to finish the job over the weekend but I managed my time to do it on after hours in weekdays.
Thanks again to extend my deadline, fortunately it is finalized now.
